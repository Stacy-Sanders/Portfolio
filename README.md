# [Portfolio](https://stacy-sanders.github.io/Portfolio/)

Using a boostrap template, Grayscale, as a jumping off point I created my first portfolio.

Projects featured include:

##Tech Training Tracker - My Red Badge final project. An individual project with MVC ASP.NET with C#. This project has been deployed via Azure App Services.

##Pet Adopter API - Blue Badge Final Project - Group Project with Andrew, Jacob, and Jonah. This is an WEB API ASP.NET project with C#. This project was turned in, but can use some updating as time allows and my skills improve.

##Static Store Front - As a Gold Badge Project, we were instructed to use HTML and CSS to create a static store front after submitting a wireframe for approval.

I have included links to LinkedIn, GitHub, and Twitter in the footer, as well as a contact section that includes my US locations, a contact form, and a downloadable version of my resume.
