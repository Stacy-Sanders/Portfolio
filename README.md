# Portfolio_Sanders-Stacy

Using a boostrap template, Grayscale, as a jumping off point I created my first portfolio.

Projects featured include:

##Tech Training Tracker - My Red Badge final project. An individual project with MVC ASP.NET with C#. This project is still evolving as the due date approaches.

##Pet Adopter API - Blue Badge Final Project - Group Project with Andrew, Jacob, and Jonah. This is an WEB API ASP.NET project with C#. This project was turned in, but can use some updating as time allows and my skills improve.

##Static Store Front - As a Gold Badge Project, we were instructed to use HTML and CSS to create a static store front after submitting a wireframe for approval.
